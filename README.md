The motive of this project was to study humans expression and to predict the emotions they are going through.
I was assigned to watch videos having Sad emotions and then select the moment having the emotion in dominance.
Then using data_extract.py file and various python libraries we downloaded these videos from moment and cropped them.
Then these videos were used to train the machine to detect these emotions.

This project was done during January 2023 under guidance of Dr. Varun Dutt.
